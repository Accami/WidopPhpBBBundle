The bundle provides a PhpBB integration for your Symfony2 project.

It only works with the [Widop phpbb3 fork](https://github.com/widop/phpbb3).

The PhpBB integration allows you to:

 - Automatically login/logout on phpbb when you connect/disconnect through your symfony project.
 - Automatically register you on phpbb when you register on your symfony project.
 - Automatically delete your phpbb account when you delete your account on your symfony project.
